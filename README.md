# NYC "Yellow Taxi" Trips

## Questions
1. Return all the trips over 0.9 percentile in the distance traveled for any Parquet files you can find there.
2. Create a continuous aggregate that rolls up stats on passenger count and fare amount by pickup location.
3. Do not implement, but explain your architecture on how youâ€™ll solve this problem. Another request we have is to upload that information to another system daily. We need a solution that allows us to push some information into our Salesforce so Sales, Finance, and Marketing can make better decisions. Some requirements to consider are:
    - We need to have a daily dump of the trips into Salesforce.
    - We should avoid duplicates and have a clear way to backfill if needed.

## Dependencies
- Timescale service (configured with `.yaml` under `taxi/timescale/databases`)
- Docker for environment with PySpark/Sedona installation and python libraries

## Usage
Build the image
```
make build
```
Start container
```
make start
```
Run the pipeline
```
make run
```
Preview database
```
make preview
```

## Database Schema
#### `location`
This table stores additional data about each taxi zone, sourced from the [Taxi Zone Lookup Table](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS location (
    LocationID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    Borough VARCHAR(50),
    Zone VARCHAR(50),
    service_zone VARCHAR(50)
);
```

#### `trip`
This is the main table, representing trip data. It has foreign key constraints to the `location` table for pickup and dropoff locations. 
*Note*: For the most part, only the subset of columns needed to answer the questions for this assignment were used.
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS trip (
    trip_distance DOUBLE PRECISION  NULL,
    fare_amount DOUBLE PRECISION    NULL,
    passenger_count INTEGER         NULL,
    PULocationID INTEGER            NULL,
    DOLocationID INTEGER            NULL,
    pickup_datetime TIMESTAMP       NOT NULL,
    dropoff_datetime TIMESTAMP      NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (PULocationID) REFERENCES location (LocationID),
    FOREIGN KEY (DOLocationID) REFERENCES location (LocationID)
);
```

Since this table holds a large volume of time series data, I made it a [hypertable](https://docs.timescale.com/use-timescale/latest/hypertables/).
I also enabled [compression](https://docs.timescale.com/use-timescale/latest/compression/) to reduce storage size.
```sql
SELECT create_hypertable('trip', 'pickup_datetime', if_not_exists => TRUE);
SELECT remove_compression_policy('trip');
SELECT add_compression_policy('trip', INTERVAL '1d');
```

#### `pickup_location_daily_summary`
This view is a solution to question (2). It is a continuous aggregate of the `trip` table, with various statistics about passenger count and fare amount for a given pickup location and day.
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS pickup_location_daily_summary
WITH (timescaledb.continuous) 
AS SELECT
    PULocationID,
    time_bucket('1 day', pickup_datetime) AS day,
    avg(passenger_count) AS avg_passenger_count,
    min(passenger_count) AS min_passenger_count,
    max(passenger_count) AS max_passenger_count,
    avg(fare_amount) AS avg_fare_amount,
    min(fare_amount) AS min_fare_amount,
    max(fare_amount) AS max_fare_amount,
    count(*) AS num_trips
FROM trip
GROUP BY day, PULocationID;
```

#### `trip_distance_daily`
This view is a daily continuous aggregate that contains percentile aggregates for `trip_distance`. Using accessors, it becomes simple and fast to then calculate approximate percentiles over various time horizons.
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW trip_distance_daily
WITH (timescaledb.continuous)
AS SELECT
    time_bucket('1 day', pickup_datetime) AS day,
    tdigest(100, trip_distance) AS tdigest
FROM trip
GROUP BY day;
```

This was useful for question (3) when calculating the 0.9 percentile in the distance traveled across all trips, where you can roll up percentile data from a continuous aggregate as demonstrated in the Timescale [documentation](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hyperfunctions/percentile-approximation/tdigest#extended-examples)
```sql
SELECT *
FROM trip
WHERE trip_distance > (SELECT approx_percentile(0.90, rollup(tdigest)) FROM trip_distance_daily);
```

## ETL Pipeline
With the database schema defined, the outstanding task was to build a pipeline that makes [TLC Trip Record Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) available from our Timescale service so that we can answer out questions. I broke this down into a few steps:
1. Download the raw `.parquet` files.
2. Normalize the data to expected format.
3. Load the normalized data to Timescale.
