- Docker image containing PySpark/Sedona installation and python libraries

## Setup
Build the image
```
make build
```
Start a container
```
make start
```
Run the process
```
make run
```

## Database Schema
- location
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS location (
    LocationID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    Borough VARCHAR(50),
    Zone VARCHAR(50),
    service_zone VARCHAR(50)
);
```
- trip
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS trip (
    trip_distance DOUBLE PRECISION  NULL,
    fare_amount DOUBLE PRECISION    NULL,
    passenger_count INTEGER         NULL,
    PULocationID INTEGER            NULL,
    DOLocationID INTEGER            NULL,
    pickup_datetime TIMESTAMP       NOT NULL,
    dropoff_datetime TIMESTAMP      NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (PULocationID) REFERENCES location (LocationID),
    FOREIGN KEY (DOLocationID) REFERENCES location (LocationID)
);
```
```sql
SELECT create_hypertable('trip', 'pickup_datetime', if_not_exists => TRUE);
SELECT remove_compression_policy('trip');
SELECT add_compression_policy('trip', INTERVAL '1d');
```
- pickup_location_daily_summary
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS pickup_location_daily_summary
WITH (timescaledb.continuous) 
AS SELECT
    PULocationID,
    time_bucket('1 day', pickup_datetime) AS day,
    avg(passenger_count) AS avg_passenger_count,
    min(passenger_count) AS min_passenger_count,
    max(passenger_count) AS max_passenger_count,
    avg(fare_amount) AS avg_fare_amount,
    min(fare_amount) AS min_fare_amount,
    max(fare_amount) AS max_fare_amount,
    count(*) AS num_trips
FROM trip
GROUP BY day, PULocationID;
```
- trip_distance_daily
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW trip_distance_daily
WITH (timescaledb.continuous)
AS SELECT
    time_bucket('1 day', pickup_datetime) AS day,
    tdigest(100, trip_distance) AS tdigest
FROM trip
GROUP BY day;
```

## Questions
1. Return all the trips over 0.9 percentile in the distance traveled for any Parquet files you can find there.
2. Create a continuous aggregate that rolls up stats on passenger count and fare amount by pickup location.
3. Do not implement, but explain your architecture on how youâ€™ll solve this problem. Another request we have is to upload that information to another system daily. We need a solution that allows us to push some information into our Salesforce so Sales, Finance, and Marketing can make better decisions. Some requirements to consider are:
    - We need to have a daily dump of the trips into Salesforce.
    - We should avoid duplicates and have a clear way to backfill if needed.
